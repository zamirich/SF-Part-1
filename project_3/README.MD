### Description    
Assume we are working as a data-scientists at Booking. One of the company's problems is hotels with fake ratings. The way to solve this is building a model that can predict hotels rating that can further be compared with the actual rating and if there is significant difference - it might mean that hotel is cheating with its rating.
